Regression
==========

Simple
------
Have some data point x, want to predict some output of interest y as f(x)  
Assumes mean error value of 0; equally likely to be + or -  
y = f(x) + E(epsilon)  

1. Which model f(x)? [quadratic]
2. Estimate a specific fit to data.
  - Find the model that fits data with minimal error.
